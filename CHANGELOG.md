# Changelog

All notable changes to TVControl are documented here. This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.5.3] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- **`capture_screenshot` refused on a chart that was working perfectly.** 2.5.0 added a
  visibility check to stop a hidden tab returning the last frame it painted (issue #3). The
  check was right; refusing was the wrong half of the fix. Measured on a live machine with
  TradingView open and running, merely sitting *behind* the terminal:

  ```
  {"vis":"hidden","hidden":true,"title":"Live stock, index, futures, Forex and Bi..."}
  ```

  macOS Chromium marks a fully occluded window hidden, not just a background tab. So the guard
  fired on the ordinary workflow, where you are looking at your agent rather than at the chart,
  and every screenshot-using skill stopped working.

  It now asks for the frame instead of giving up: `Page.bringToFront()` makes the target
  visible, which is what actually resumes compositing, so the capture is both possible and
  current. Only if fronting fails to make it visible (minimised, or on another Space) does it
  refuse, because at that point a capture really would be stale. The result carries
  `brought_to_front: true` when the window had to be raised, since that is a visible change on
  your desktop. An already-visible target is never touched.

- **`ClassifiedError` was discarding its own diagnostics.** The constructor kept `hint` and
  `cause` and dropped every other option on the floor, so ten fields across six modules never
  reached a caller: `shape_requested` / `shape_created` on a rejected drawing, `editor_bound_to`
  on a mis-bound Pine editor, `candidates` on an ambiguous script name, `requested_date` and
  `days_away` on a relocated replay cursor, `dialog_buttons` on a blocked tab close. Every one
  of those refusals told you a decision had been made and withheld the facts behind it. They
  travel in `details` now, and `toJSON` surfaces them on the wire.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- **The replay guard now has three answers, not two.** 2.5.1 correctly unwrapped
  TradingView's `WatchedValue` so an inactive replay stopped reading as active. What it left
  was a two-value answer to a three-value question: an object with no recognised accessor was
  still truthy, so a future rename of `.value()` would refuse every timeframe change again
  while reporting "replay is running", which is an assertion about a state nobody read.

  `unknown` is now its own answer. It still blocks, because a real replay session slipping
  through is the worse outcome, but the error says the state could not be determined and names
  the shape it saw. `.get()` and a plain `value` property are recognised too, and a probe that
  could not run at all (no chart, no CDP) is treated as "no replay session to protect" rather
  than as an unreadable one.

- **Windows CI was red for six runs because of a test, not the product.**
  `tests/cli_mcp_parity.test.js` dynamically imported the CLI command modules by absolute path.
  On Windows that throws `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`, so its `before()` hook died and all
  14 tests came back `cancelledByParent` on both Windows runners while passing everywhere else.
  It uses `pathToFileURL` now.

- **Two vulnerable transitive dependencies.** `fast-uri` (high) and `qs` (moderate), both
  reached through `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, failed the CI dependency audit. Lockfile bumped
  to `fast-uri@3.1.7` and `qs@6.16.0`; the SDK version is unchanged. `npm audit` reports zero
  vulnerabilities.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Read the boolean inside TradingView's watched replay state before guarding a
  timeframe change. An inactive replay wrapper previously evaluated as truthy,
  preventing normal chart collection and falsely reporting replay as active.
  Real active replay remains blocked. Regression tests execute the page-side
  check for both plain booleans and watched values.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-09-08

Every open issue from the external bug reports (#3 to #11), closed. Eight of the nine are
one bug wearing different clothes: a result built from the request instead of from a read.

### Added

- **`pine_get_script_source`** reads a saved Pine Script over the REST API without touching
  the editor buffer. Requested in #10: reading a saved script is the common case, and routing
  it through the editor is what puts a script at risk. `pine_open` already fetched over this
  endpoint before injecting, so this is the same read with the dangerous half removed.

### Fixed

- **`pine_open` pasted source into the previously open script (#11).** `setValue` is a text
  mutation: it put the target source into whatever buffer was open and left the editor bound
  to the PREVIOUS script, while returning `{success: true, name: <target>}`. A following
  `pine_save` wrote the opened script code over the previous one. Four saved scripts on the
  reporting account ended up sharing one in-code title that way.

  The obvious check does not catch it: comparing the buffer against a known copy of the target
  passes, because the text really is the target. It proves the fetch, not the binding. The
  panel title is now read back. A mismatch throws and names both scripts; an unreadable title
  returns `binding_verified: false` with a warning rather than a confident wrong answer.

- **`pine_open` had no `confirm_overwrite` guard (#10)**, unlike `pine_new` and
  `pine_set_source`. Opening a script is how an agent reads one, so it is reached for early
  and often, and it was destroying unsaved work silently. It now runs the same guard, before
  the fetch: refusing after the buffer is gone is not a guard.

- **An ambiguous script name is now reported, not resolved (#10).** 20 of 53 scripts on the
  reporting account have a list name and an in-code title that disagree, and one in-code title
  was shared by four saved scripts. The substring fallback took the first hit and said nothing.
  It now returns the candidates and refuses.

- **`capture_screenshot` returned a stale frame from a hidden tab (#3).** Chromium suspends
  canvas compositing for a background tab, so the call returned a real PNG of the right chart
  showing the wrong data, with the header, quote and clock current while the candles were
  frozen. Three consecutive captures 40 seconds apart were byte-similar. It now refuses unless
  the tab is visible; `allow_hidden: true` overrides and says the check was skipped.

- **`capture_screenshot region:"chart"` captured the first pane, not the active one (#4).**
  `querySelector` takes the first match, so on a 2x2 layout every capture was pane 0 whatever
  `pane_focus` said. It bit hardest with replay running on the active pane. It now prefers the
  active pane, reports `pane_selected_by`, and warns loudly when it had to fall back to the
  first of several.

- **A timed-out readiness check was reported as a failed mutation (#5).** `setSymbol` and
  `setResolution` have already run by the time the wait expires, so throwing told a caller
  nothing had changed when everything had, and a caller that retries double-applies. They now
  return `chart_ready: false` with a note saying not to retry. `indicator_add_from_search`
  polled nothing: it slept a flat 1500 ms and then diffed the study list, so a study that took
  ~2 s to appear produced "no new study appeared" on a call that had added it. It now polls to
  an 8 s deadline, so an empty diff is real evidence of absence.

  The contract, now stated in the tool descriptions: **a thrown error means nothing changed.**

- **`tab_close` was blocked by the unsaved-changes dialog and blamed the tab count (#6).** The
  dialog is its own CDP page target, invisible to every selector the chart page can run, and
  the old message read like a selector or window-scoping problem. It cost the reporter most of
  a session. It is now found by enumerating targets, reported by name, and dismissed so the
  chart is not left blocked. `discard_unsaved: true` answers it with "Close without saving".
  "Save and close" is never clicked automatically.

- **`replay_start` silently relocated an out-of-range date (#7).** A 5-minute request for
  2020-12-08 on CME_MINI:NQ1! put the cursor on 2021-08-22 and returned success, with `date`
  echoing the request. Every read taken afterwards was then correct for a date the caller never
  asked for. It now compares the two, refuses beyond a 4-day tolerance (a weekend is not a
  depth limit), stops replay rather than leaving the caller in a session pointing at the wrong
  date, and always reports `relocated` and the real `current_date`. `allow_relocation: true`
  accepts it.

- **Changing timeframe during replay is refused (#7, related).** It left the cursor on the old
  timeframe, the new series came back empty, and data reads hung on `chart_loading` until
  replay was stopped.

- **`draw_shape` reported success for an unknown shape and silently created a flag (#8).**
  TradingView falls back to a default for a name it does not recognise, and the result echoed
  the name that was asked for. The created shape name is now read back; a mismatch removes the
  wrong drawing and throws. The `shape` parameter documents the 20 names verified on 3.3.0
  instead of 5.

- **The CLI can now reach every safety guard (#9).** `expect_title` and `discard_unsaved` on
  `tv tab close`, `discard_unsaved` on `tv layout switch`, `confirm_overwrite` on `tv pine
  new/set/open`, `enabled` on `tv replay autoplay`, `overwrite` on `tv state snapshot`,
  `frequency` and `resolution` on `tv alert create`, `allow_hidden` on `tv screenshot`,
  `allow_relocation` on `tv replay start`, plus `tv pine source`. Three of these were refusals
  whose own hint named a flag the CLI did not have, which is a dead end rather than a decision.
  `tests/cli_mcp_parity.test.js` now executes both sides and compares them.

## [2.4.9] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **`docs/EMBEDDING.md` — the spawn contract for host applications**, shipped in the tarball
  so a host author with an installed package can read it. It exists because both embedding
  failures we have seen happen *before* the server's first JSON-RPC frame, so neither can
  report itself and both surface as a bare `-32000: Connection closed`.

  The one that is still live: a host that spawns the `tvcontrol` bin with a scrubbed
  environment exits **127** with `env: node: No such file or directory`. The shebang is
  `#!/usr/bin/env node`, and node installed through nvm, fnm, volta or asdf is never on a
  bare PATH.

  This cannot be fixed inside the package. The kernel resolves the shebang before a line of
  our code runs, and repointing it at a shell that self-locates node would make npm's Windows
  `.cmd` shim invoke `sh` — `cmd-shim` takes the interpreter from the shebang verbatim. That
  would trade a conditional POSIX failure for a certain Windows one.

  The host already holds a runtime it can be sure exists: its own. The contract is to spawn
  `process.execPath` with an absolute path to `src/server.js`, plus `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`
  on an Electron host. `examples/mcp-config.example.json` now carries an absolute-node variant
  for the same reason, and `tests/embedding_contract.test.js` holds both to it.

## [2.4.8] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- **The server no longer refuses to start when it cannot read its own source.** Windows users
  running the bundled server out of `C:\Program Files\` got nothing but
  `MCP error -32000: Connection closed`, with `EPERM reading ...` on stderr. The cause was in
  our own startup path: 2.3.1 made the server derive its version and tool count by reading
  `package.json` and scanning `src/tools/` at module load, so that it could stop introducing
  itself with hand-maintained numbers that were wrong. Neither read was guarded.

  Program Files ACLs and Controlled Folder Access deny directory *enumeration* to a
  non-elevated process long before they deny anything else, so `readdirSync` threw. It threw at
  import time, before the MCP server object existed, which is why the client saw a closed pipe
  and no error: there was no protocol channel left to report on.

  Both reads now fail soft. The scan stays primary, because a derived count is the only kind
  that cannot drift, and when it throws the server falls back to the catalog generated at
  publish time (`src/core/catalog_fallback.js`) and says so on stderr. `tv_capability_matrix`
  reports `catalog_source: "scan" | "fallback"` so a degraded session is visible rather than
  silently plausible. An empty scan result counts as a failed read, not as a package with no
  tools.

  The fallback cannot go stale: `tests/startup_resilience.test.js` fails the build if it
  diverges from a live scan or from `package.json`. Regenerate with
  `node scripts/gen_tool_catalog.js`. That test also spawns the real entrypoint against a
  tools directory chmod'ed to `0111` - traversable, not listable, the POSIX shape of the
  Windows denial - and requires a full MCP handshake and the whole catalog back.

## [2.4.7] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- **Launching TradingView handed it an environment that makes it crash.** We inherited the full
  parent environment, and this connector nearly always runs under a Node process, so TradingView's
  Electron native-module resolver guessed the wrong runtime and died on an uncaught exception
  before the chart opened (`No native build was found for platform=darwin arch=arm64
  runtime=electron abi=145`, with `libc=glibc` on a Mac as the tell). The launcher now passes only
  what a GUI app needs, drops everything Node/npm/nvm/bun/pnpm/yarn/volta/fnm/asdf/Electron
  specific, and pins PATH so a shim cannot reintroduce it.

- **`kill_existing: true` failed every time on macOS, not occasionally.** Teardown waited a flat
  1500 ms. Measured on Darwin 25.3: the process was still alive and port 9222 still bound at
  6217 ms. The replacement was spawned 4.7 seconds early, the OS refused it, and the caller got a
  bare "TradingView failed during startup" with no remedy. One live session burned 437 steps
  looping on that. It now polls for the process being gone AND the port released, to a 20 s
  deadline.

- **`indicator_search` stamped `verified_empty` on a case mismatch.** TradingView's matching is
  not case-insensitive for saved scripts: on the account that owns it, `"tc-tide"` returned 3
  results and `"TC-TIDE"` returned 0 with `verified_empty: true`. The query is now retried
  lower-case before any empty verdict.

- 2.4.7 was published to npm from an uncommitted working tree, and shipped with a red test. Both
  fixed: the release is now committed, tagged and reproducible.

## [2.4.6] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- **Refuse a CDP endpoint that is not TradingView.** Connecting to whatever answered on the
  debug port meant a stray Chrome could be driven as if it were the chart.

## [2.4.5] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- **`layout_create` no longer hands back a chart that cannot be used.** It returned as soon as
  the widget's layout id changed, which happens long before the chart has a series. Measured on
  a live setup run: the very next calls failed - `indicator_add_from_search` reported
  "TradingView accepted TC-TIDE but no new study appeared" and `chart_set_timeframe` reported
  "Chart did not finish loading" twice - and the caller had to sleep and retry to recover work
  this tool had already claimed was done.

  It now waits for a loaded series (`waitForChartReady`, which the rest of the codebase already
  used) before saving, and reports `chart_ready`. That is reported rather than thrown: the
  layout exists and is named by this point, so raising here would make a retrying caller create
  a duplicate.

- **`indicator_add_from_search` refuses an unloaded chart** instead of half-adding to it.
  Nothing has been created when it checks, so a retry is free - unlike the old behaviour, where
  the click landed on a chart with nothing to attach to and reported an unexplained failure.

## [2.4.4] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- **`indicator_search` no longer reports an unverified zero.** It typed the query, waited a
  fixed 1200 ms, read the dialog once, and returned whatever was on screen as
  `success: true, count: 0`. An empty result list and a catalogue that has not finished
  loading render identically, so "the account does not have this script" and "ask again in ten
  seconds" came back as the same answer.

  This cost a real buyer run. Forty-two seconds after TradingView was relaunched, a search for
  the private study `TC-TIDE` returned `count: 0` on the account that owns it. The setup skill
  read that as "not favourited yet" and told the user to go and add a script already sitting in
  their My scripts list. The setup dead-ended there and no brief was ever produced.

  An empty read is now retried, and then checked against a control query — a built-in study
  present on every account. If the control matches, the zero is real and comes back with
  `verified_empty: true` and the control's row count as evidence. If the control is empty too,
  the surface is not answering and the call raises `chart_loading` rather than inventing an
  absence. A search that finds rows is unchanged and never runs the control.

- **`indicator_add_from_search` gets the same guard.** `No matching study found` had the
  identical race: it could mean the study is absent, or that nothing had loaded yet. It now
  proves the catalogue answers before classifying the failure as `study_not_found`.

## [2.4.3] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- **`watchlist_create`** — make a NEW named watchlist and populate it in one call.
  `watchlist_import` and `watchlist_add_bulk` both write into whichever list is already
  ACTIVE, so neither could create one. Without a create, a first-run setup can only borrow a
  list the user already has — which is how a "fresh install" test ends up quietly riding on
  the tester's own account and proving nothing.

  `POST /api/v1/symbols_list/custom/` with body `{name, symbols}`. Note the shape: an OBJECT,
  where `append`/`remove` on the same endpoint family take a bare ARRAY. It refuses a
  duplicate name by default — TradingView allows them, and two lists called `RebelUOS` have
  already caused one real misdiagnosis on a live account — and it re-reads the account rather
  than trusting the create response, because a response describing an action is the action
  reporting on itself.

- **`layout_create` and `layout_save`** — create a new chart layout and save it under a name,
  with no dialog. Previously `layout_list`, `layout_switch` and `layout_get_active` could only
  reach layouts that already existed.

  Read live off Desktop 3.4.0 rather than guessed: the obvious names are all traps.
  `saveNewChart`, `createEmptyChart` and `renameChart` each resolve to `controller.show()` —
  they open a MODAL and return immediately, so headlessly they report success while a dialog
  waits for a human who is not there. The two that work silently are `createNewLayout` and
  `saveChartToServer` → `_saveChartService.saveChartSilently`.

  Naming happens at SAVE time (`opts.chartName`), not at create time — `createNewLayout`
  ignores its argument as a name.

### Fixed during development, recorded because it reached a live account

- **A first cut of `layout_create` RENAMED a live user's chart.** `createNewLayout` returns a
  new id and moves the URL via `history.replaceState`, but it does not load that chart into
  the running widget. The save then wrote the new name to "the current chart" — still the
  user's own layout — and reported `confirmed_in_account: true`, truthfully, about the wrong
  chart. Every check in that version passed.

  `layout_create` now waits for the WIDGET's own layout id to change before saving anything,
  and refuses to save at all if it has not. A URL comparison is not evidence: the URL moves
  without the chart loading, and trusting it is precisely what caused the rename. It also
  refuses to run at all when the current chart has unsaved changes, since reaching the new
  chart means navigating away from it — pass `discard_unsaved: true` to override.

  Verified live: layout count 460 → 461, the user's layout untouched, the new layout listed
  by the account rather than by the tool.

### Changed

- Tool count 109 → 112. All three new tools are classified as mutating: they are refused by a
  read-only server and take the mutation lease.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **`layout_switch` against TradingView Desktop 3.3.0** — it reported success while the
  chart never moved. Reading the live function shows why:
  `async loadChartFromServer(e){ await (this._loadChartService?.loadChart(e,!1)) }`.
  `loadChart(entry, openInNewTab, skipUnsavedCheck)` wants the SAVED-CHART ENTRY, not an id:
  it builds its route from `entry.url` and hands the whole object to
  `backend.loadLayout(entry)`. A bare number leaves `entry.url` undefined, so it navigates to
  `/chart/undefined/` and NOTHING HAPPENS — no throw, no rejected promise, just a chart that
  never changes. The id path did exactly that, and the name path resolved an entry only to
  throw its id back at the same shim.

  Both paths now resolve the entry and call the service directly, with `discard_unsaved`
  passed as the third argument so TradingView skips its own dialog when discarding was
  actually requested. The button-clicking path stays as a fallback for builds that still
  raise the dialog, and the `loadChartFromServer` shim stays for builds with no
  `_loadChartService`.

  This matters beyond one tool: an unattended scan that cannot change layout silently reads
  whatever chart happens to be open, and `tv_compatibility_check` reported
  `compatible: true` throughout, so the failure was completely silent.

- **`layout_switch` no longer guesses between similar layout names.** The partial match took
  the first hit, so `TCTide` could resolve to **`TCTide Crypto`** and run a stocks scan
  against a crypto book with no error raised anywhere. A partial name now resolves only when
  exactly one layout matches it; more than one is refused with every candidate named. An
  unknown or ambiguous name is classified `INVALID_ARGUMENT` rather than `TV_UI_CHANGED`,
  whose hint told the user to report a TradingView UI change that had not happened.

  Verified live on 3.3.0: switch by id, switch by name, and an ambiguous partial refused with
  the chart left untouched. Four contract tests added to
  `tests/layout_switch_contract.test.js`; three of the four are mutation-proven, and the file
  records that a source-text assertion cannot catch every logic mutation.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- **`TV_MCP_READONLY=1`** — a read-only mode that registers only the 58 tools of the
  110-tool catalog that cannot mutate the user's TradingView state. It exists because an
  MCP grant is server-level, not per-tool: an unattended run that is allowed to talk to
  TVControl at all is allowed to call `watchlist_remove_bulk`, `alert_delete`, `draw_clear`,
  `pine_save` and `tv_launch` against a real trading account with nobody watching. Under the
  flag those tools are NOT REGISTERED — absent from `tools/list`, refused by the MCP layer as
  unknown — so the safety property is structural rather than a rule the model is asked to
  follow. The gate is one choke point in `src/server.js`, and the allowlist is an
  enumeration, so a tool added later is denied until it is classified on purpose.

  Chart NAVIGATION stays available (symbol, timeframe, visible range, pane focus, pane
  symbol, tab and layout switching). It moves the view of anyone watching the chart, but it
  destroys nothing and a universe scan cannot work without it — reading a Pine table across
  74 symbols means setting the symbol 74 times. Anything that PERSISTS or DESTROYS is denied,
  including `state_restore` (it makes the chart match the snapshot, dropping studies and
  drawings), `strategy_sweep` (it rewrites indicator inputs), raw UI actuation, and every
  process-level action. `ui_evaluate` stays unregistered even when `TV_MCP_ADVANCED=1` is
  also set: read-only wins.

  `batch_run` IS registered. Its action enum contains read actions only — `screenshot`,
  `get_ohlcv`, `get_strategy_results`, `get_study_values`, `get_pine_tables` — and it restores
  the starting symbol and timeframe in a `finally` block. `tests/readonly.test.js` pins that
  enum as the server publishes it, so adding a mutating action there fails the suite instead
  of silently reopening everything this gate closes.

- **`tests/readonly.test.js`** boots the real server as a subprocess and asserts on
  `tools/list`, not on a mock's bookkeeping. It checks the exact registered set with the flag,
  the set without it (so the pass cannot be vacuous), the flag beating `TV_MCP_ADVANCED`, a
  `tools/call` of a blocked tool returning an unknown-tool error, and a `tools/call` of an
  allowed tool actually reaching the connection layer. Every guard was mutation-proven: the
  fix was removed, the test was confirmed to fail, and the fix restored.

### Changed

- `tv_capability_matrix` now reports `readonly_mode` and derives each tool's `registered`
  flag from the same predicate the server registers by, so the matrix cannot claim a tool is
  available in a session where the server never registered it. The server's headline tool
  count and description are likewise derived from what it actually registered.

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-21

Minor, not a patch: two new tools and several changed return shapes.

### Added

- **`alert_create_bulk`** — create price alerts across many symbols, or the
  whole active watchlist, in one call. Does not touch the chart. Each alert can
  carry a `webhook_url`, so every fire posts to your own endpoint instead of
  your inbox. `percent_from_last` prices each alert from that symbol's own live
  price, which is the only level that means the same thing across a mixed
  watchlist. `dry_run: true` returns the full plan without creating anything.
  The whole batch is verified with a single read of the alert list afterwards.
  Measured: 29-symbol dry run in 536ms; three real webhook alerts created and
  verified in 2s.
- **`quote_batch`** — live quotes for many symbols in one server-side request.
  29 symbols in 272ms. Names the symbols it could not resolve rather than
  returning a shorter list. `quote_get` switches the chart symbol and takes
  about 20s each, so it must never be looped.
- **`tests/study_addressing.test.js`** executes the real page-side JS against
  a fake TradingView, so logic that lives inside an `evaluate()` template is
  covered rather than assumed.
- **`tests/hermetic_deps.test.js`** and a `TV_MCP_NO_CDP` guard that makes any
  real browser call from an offline test throw and name itself.

### Fixed

- **Two blind external audits (Codex 5.6, Kimi K3) reviewed this release and
  both returned block.** Nineteen findings, all closed. The sharpest landed on
  `tv_repair_chart` itself: it returned `success: true` unconditionally and
  reconnected a pane whose poisoned study it had failed to remove, restarting
  the very loop it exists to end. Both auditors ranked that first. Also fixed:
  the study add ignored the EntityId `createStudy` returns and diffed the study
  list instead; `alert_create_bulk` verified that an id came back but never
  that the alert was on the requested symbol; a healthy mid-load pane was
  reported as damaged with advice to run the destructive repair tool;
  `TV_MCP_NO_CDP` did not cover three modules that reach the browser directly
  while its comment claimed it covered everything; `layoutSwitch` read its
  baseline after firing the switch, so it could only fail successful switches;
  the Pine overwrite guard treated any script under 200 characters as
  disposable; `closeTab` proved only that the count dropped, never which tab
  went; and `ui_type_text` never re-checked that focus had held across the
  write. Every fix is mutation-tested.
- **A chart pane would break permanently and the only apparent cure was
  rebuilding the layout.** One pane sits in a reconnect loop while the rest of
  the layout is fine. Diagnosed live by instrumenting the chart session:

  ```
  14ms   connect
  14ms   _sendCreateSession   sid=cs_xm4Yn7i7Qkxa  state=1
  108ms  _onCriticalError     "Invalid parameters"
         method: create_study  args: [[], st4, sds_18, Script@tv-scripting-101!, ...]
  ```

  The pane replays its studies onto the new session and sends `create_study`
  with an empty array where a string id belongs. The server rejects it as a
  CRITICAL error, which destroys the session, and the next reconnect does it
  again. It cannot self-heal: while in that state `symbolSameAsResolved()`
  returns true although `symbolInfo()` is null, so re-setting the same symbol
  is a silent no-op and every obvious manual remedy does nothing.

  **The empty id was ours.** TradingView returns Promises from `createStudy`
  (`Promise<EntityId>` since charting library 1.15), `setSymbol`,
  `setResolution` and `createMultipointShape`. TVControl called them
  fire-and-forget and read the result after a fixed sleep. Losing that race
  leaves a study with no server id, which is why this struck at random. All of
  them are now properly awaited, and `chart_manage_indicator` removes a study
  that comes back without a usable id rather than leaving it on the chart.

  `state_restore`'s `insertStudyWithoutCheck` path is gone. Measured, it took a
  healthy pane from session `cs_VmBPx3nc31XM` state 2 to `""` state 0 in one
  call, and never once produced a registered study. The inject paths now treat
  registration, not the source count going up, as success, remove anything they
  added without registering, and reconnect the session if one of them killed it.
- **The same session-killing code was left behind in `sweep_parallel.js`.**
  `strategy_sweep` still called `insertStudyWithoutCheck` and still judged
  success by the source count going up, so it could poison a pane in exactly
  the way that was just fixed elsewhere. Removed, registration is the test, an
  unregistered study is dropped, and the session is reconnected if an attempt
  killed it. The sweep workers also await `setSymbol` and `setResolution`
  rather than firing them: a sweep that reads bars before the symbol changed
  records a wrong number instead of failing visibly.
- **`pane_set_symbol` verified the label, not the instrument.** It polled
  `ms.symbol()`, which flips the moment `setSymbol` is called, and reported
  `verified: true` on it. That confirms the request rather than the result,
  and a pane holding a label with no resolved instrument is the
  stuck-on-reconnect state. It now requires `symbolInfo()` to resolve, and
  distinguishes "the label never changed" from "the label changed but the
  symbol never resolved" in the error.
- **Added `tv_chart_health` and `tv_repair_chart`.** Health reports each pane's
  data session and names any study that will kill it on reconnect. Repair
  removes those studies and reconnects the pane, naming everything it removed
  so it can be added back with `indicator_add_from_search`. TradingView's own
  event sources (dividends, splits, earnings, roll dates) can never be removed
  by it. `chart_get_state` now carries a `chart_health` block when the pane it
  is describing is broken, so the problem is surfaced without being asked for.
  Verified live: a deliberately poisoned pane detected, repaired, session back
  as `cs_1HAJtX6Rannw`, and a healthy same-named study on the pane untouched.
- **Correction.** An earlier 2.3.0 change claimed TradingView gives every Pine
  study an empty-array id. That was wrong, generalised from one broken pane.
  The control, on two panes of the same layout: healthy Pine studies had ids
  `Uqd28X` and `rExi1w`, the broken pane's had `[]`. The empty array is damage,
  not a Pine convention, and it is now reported as damage with a pointer to the
  repair rather than as a quirk to work around.
- **`pane_set_symbol` could write to the wrong pane and report success.**
  `pane_focus` clicked `_mainDiv` and then returned `focused: idx` straight
  from its own argument. Whether the click landed, whether the div existed,
  whether the chart honoured it: all three produced the same answer. The same
  failure as the old `tab_switch`, which reported a switch it never performed.

  `pane_set_symbol` built on it: focus, wait 300ms, write to "the now-active
  chart", return `success: true` echoing the caller's own symbol back. Nothing
  checked that the focus took, that the symbol changed, or that it changed on
  the pane that was asked for. A silently failed click meant
  `pane_set_symbol(1, "X")` rewrote pane 0 and said it had done pane 1.

  `pane_focus` now polls an independent read of which pane is really active and
  throws rather than reporting a move that did not happen. `pane_set_symbol`
  records every pane's symbol first, re-confirms the active pane immediately
  before writing, polls until the symbol lands, and refuses if any other pane
  changed. It reports `previous` and the symbol TradingView actually settled on
  rather than the request. Verified live, including the case that matters: with
  pane 1 active, writing to pane 0 landed on pane 0 and pane 1 was untouched.
- **A Pine study had no address, so four tools could never reach one.**
  TradingView gives a built-in study a string id ("T4x6LH") and gives every
  Pine study its own distinct empty Array. `getStudyById` resolves that by
  reference identity, so a fresh `[]` throws "There is no such study": the id
  is a handle, not data, and it cannot survive serialization. `chart_get_state`
  was returning that `[]` to callers as their `entity_id`, and
  `data_get_indicator`, `indicator_set_inputs`, `indicator_toggle_visibility`
  and `chart_manage_indicator` all take an `entity_id` string. On a product
  whose users keep their work in Pine, none of them worked on it.

  `chart_get_state` now reports `id: null` with `addressable_by: "name"` and
  the `script_id` from metaInfo, and all four tools resolve the study in the
  page, where the reference still exists. Verified live: a 66-input Pine
  indicator read, hidden, shown and had an input set and reverted, all by name.
  An ambiguous name is refused rather than guessed.
- **`state_snapshot` captured no `metaInfo` for any study**, while the README
  promised "the full `metaInfo` blob for published Pine, even ones that
  normally won't reload". The dataSource index was keyed on `src.id()`, which
  returns the empty string for Pine, and empty string is falsy, so not one Pine
  dataSource ever entered the map. The name fallback searched that same map, so
  it missed too. With no metaInfo the study was not recognised as Pine and its
  encoded source input was stripped as oversized: measured on a real indicator,
  66 inputs captured instead of 67, and the missing one was the source blob
  that makes the study reconstructable.

  Snapshots now index dataSources by description as well. Two studies sharing
  a name are refused rather than guessed, and the snapshot says why. Verified
  live end to end: snapshot a private Pine study, remove it from the chart with
  the count confirmed, and rebuild it from the snapshot alone.
- **`chart_manage_indicator` remove returned a hardcoded success.** It called
  `removeEntity` and said `success: true` without looking, so a bad id, a
  Pine study, or a throw inside the page all reported the same thing as a real
  removal. It now counts before and after and names the study that went.
- **The offline test suite was calling `removeAllShapes()` on the live chart.**
  `restore()` called `drawing.clearAll()` and `pane.setLayout()` with no
  `_deps`, and the dependency fallback fails open, so both resolved to the real
  CDP functions. Every `npm test` cleared the drawings on whichever pane was
  active. It did no damage only because that pane was empty. `snapshot()` had
  the same hole in three read paths. All five now thread `_deps`.
- **The test count moved between runs of the same tree** — 638, 625, 638, all
  reported green. `--test-force-exit`, added to work around the hang caused by
  the leak above, was racing the run to a close and taking live tests with it.
  Removed. Four consecutive runs now report 645/645 and the suite exits on its
  own in about 13s, down from roughly 40s.
- **The server misdescribed itself to every client.** It announced version
  2.2.1 with "102 tools" while shipping 2.2.6 and registering 103 of a
  104-tool catalog. Version and both counts are now derived at startup and
  asserted against what the server actually returns on the wire.
- **`pine_new` reported `new_script_created` and created nothing.** It replaced
  the editor buffer with a template. It now refuses to overwrite a non-trivial
  buffer without `confirm_overwrite: true`, and fails closed when it cannot
  read the buffer to check.
- **A concurrency test asserted wall-clock time** and failed on a loaded
  machine while the code under test was correct. It now counts how many
  sections are in flight at once, which is the property it was trying to prove.

### Changed

- `README` corrected: it claimed 102 tools and 512 tests, and headlined
  "What is new in 2.2.0" two releases later. It now carries the real counts
  (105 tools registered by default, 732 tests) and documents the watchlist-wide alert sweep.

## [2.2.6] - 2026-08-20

Two independent adversarial audits (Kimi K3, Codex 5.6) reviewed 2.2.5 with full
repository access. Both returned the same verdict — do not ship — and converged,
separately, on the same defect class: **an action that did not happen was
reporting success.** That is the bug this project keeps rediscovering, and the
2.2.5 fixes had reintroduced it one layer up from where it was fixed.

Live testing against a real account then found three more that neither audit
could see from the source.

### Fixed — success now requires verification, everywhere

- **`alert_delete_by_id` reported success while the alert was still there.** The
  independent read set `verified: false` and `success: true` sat right beside
  it. Every caller in this codebase branches on `success`.
- **`alert_delete_by_id` treated a failed verification read as proof of
  deletion.** `list()` returns `{success: false, alerts: []}` rather than
  throwing, so `(after.alerts || []).some(...)` found nothing in an empty array
  and concluded the alert was gone. An expired session was being recorded as
  evidence.
- **`alert_delete_by_id` "deleted" alerts that never existed.** Found live: id
  `999999999999` returned `success: true, verified: true`. The endpoint accepts
  any id, and "it is not in the list afterwards" is trivially true of something
  that was never in the list. Presence is now established first.
- **`alert_delete` (the bulk path, and the one the CLI uses) had no verification
  at all.** `deleted_count` was `ids.length` — the number requested, presented
  as the number that happened. A partial success in a batch of 50 reported all
  50 deleted.
- **`alert_create` trusted its own POST response.** It now confirms the alert
  exists from a separate read.
- **`watchlist_import` counted failed adds as added.** `add()` returned
  `{success: false}` instead of throwing, and the import loop only treated a
  throw as failure. A symbol that never arrived was reported in `added` with
  top-level `success: true`. `add()` and `remove()` now throw when their own
  verification fails.
- **`watchlist_remove_bulk` called symbols it never touched "removed".** The
  rule was `!was_present || removed`, which defines absence as success.
  Removing `AAPL` from a list holding `NASDAQ:AAPL` posted nothing and reported
  success. `not_found` and `survived` are now reported separately, and neither
  counts as a removal.
- **A whitespace-only symbol reported success.** `["   "]` filtered to `[]`, and
  `[].every(...)` is `true`.
- **`watchlist_get` turned a 200-with-error-body into an empty watchlist.**
  `{"s":"error"}` has no `id` and no `symbols` array; the shape is now checked.
- **Mutations could be verified against a different watchlist.** If the active
  list changed mid-flight, list B could confirm a mutation to list A.
- **`pine_list_scripts` reported an empty library when the fetch failed.** It
  returned `success: true, total: 0` with the error in a field nobody reads.
  That tells someone with 276 scripts that they have none.
- **`batch_run` with `get_study_values` could report an all-green scan that read
  nothing.** `getStudyValues` returned `success: true, count: 0` whether the
  chart had no indicators or the extraction had broken. It now distinguishes
  the two, and reports how many studies it actually saw.

### Fixed — found by live testing, not by either audit

- **A bare ticker was stored verbatim.** `POST /append/` with `["KO"]` stores
  the literal string `"KO"`; it does not resolve to `NYSE:KO`. The old DOM path
  went through TradingView's own autocomplete and always wrote the qualified
  form. The REST rewrite lost that, and verification made it *worse*, because
  the read-back finds the exact string that was posted — so a row TradingView
  may never resolve verified as a success. Bare tickers now resolve through
  symbol search before being posted, and one that resolves to nothing is
  refused.
- **`quotes_available` was true while no returned symbol had a price.** The
  panel was rendering a different watchlist entirely: 59 DOM symbols, 29 API
  symbols, zero overlap. It now reports what actually matched and says plainly
  when the visible list is not the active one.
- **`watchlist_export` destroyed section structure.** Schema 2 adds `entries` —
  the stored list verbatim, headers in place and in order. Verified on a live
  39-entry watchlist with 10 sections: exported, order preserved, restorable.

### Added

- **`alert_create` takes `frequency` and `resolution`.** Both were hardcoded, so
  an agent could only ever create a one-shot alert on the 1-minute series. The
  vocabulary had to be determined empirically against the live API: of seventeen
  plausible frequency names, it accepts exactly **two** — `on_first_fire` and
  `on_bar_close`. Everything else returns a bare `invalid_request`. Bad values
  are now refused up front with a message that names the valid ones.
- **`tv pine list` gained `--filter`, `--limit` and `--offset`.** Paging landed
  in 2.2.5 without CLI flags, so scripts past the first 50 were unreachable and
  `next_offset` was advice the CLI could not take.

### Changed

- Caller mistakes in `watchlist_export` / `watchlist_import` (bad path, missing
  file, malformed JSON) are now `invalid_argument` rather than `api_unexpected`,
  which had been sending people to look at TradingView for their own typo.
- Duplicate symbols in bulk calls are collapsed, so `added_count` counts rows
  rather than requests.
- Dead code the 2.2.5 rewrite orphaned has been removed.

### Tests

Both audits made the same criticism of the 2.2.5 tests, and it was correct: they
assert that strings appear in the source, and every one of them passed while the
defects above were live. Two of them actively *permitted* the bug by asserting
`verified: false` alongside `success: true`.

`tests/verification_contract.test.js` is behavioural and exercises the failure
paths. 13 of its cases fail against the pre-fix source; the ones that pass are
happy-path cases that were already correct. The source-text tests are kept, but
as what they are: anti-reversion tripwires, not evidence of correctness.

571 offline tests. Verified live: watchlist 29 → 30 → 29, bare `KO` resolved to
`NYSE:KO` and removed, garbage ticker refused, alerts 164 → 165 → 164, phantom
delete refused, export round-trip preserving all 39 entries and 10 sections.

### Fixed — second audit round, on the fixes themselves

The 2.2.6 fixes were put back through the same adversarial review that rejected
2.2.5. It found four more, three of them in code written that same night.

- **`watchlist_import` in `replace` mode duplicated every section header.** The
  removal loop iterated the header-free symbol list, so existing headers were
  never removed; the add loop then worked from a header-free set and appended
  the incoming headers on top of them. A "replace" produced two of each section
  and reported them as restored. Replace now operates on the stored entries,
  headers included.
- **`watchlist_add` hid which listing it picked.** A bare ticker usually exists
  on several exchanges — `KO` is NYSE, and also Frankfurt. `addBulk` disclosed
  the choice and the alternatives; `add`, which is what `watchlist_add`
  actually calls, dropped them. Both report `resolved_from` and `alternatives`
  now.
- **You could add a symbol you could not then remove.** `add("KO")` resolved and
  stored `NYSE:KO`; `remove("KO")` did not resolve, found nothing spelled `KO`,
  and reported that the symbol was not in the watchlist, which was false.
  `removeBulk` now matches a bare ticker against the list it just read — a local
  match, not a search call. An ambiguous ticker is refused rather than guessed,
  because deleting the wrong row is not recoverable.
- **The section header paths skipped the same-list guard** that the symbol paths
  carry, so a watchlist switched mid-operation could have the wrong list answer
  for whether a header landed.

### Changed

- `alert_create` deliberately does **not** throw when its confirmation read
  fails, while `alert_delete_by_id` does. The asymmetry was flagged in review
  and kept: the safe response to an unconfirmed delete is to look and retry,
  but retrying an unconfirmed create makes a second alert. Creation reports
  `verified: null` with a note explaining why not to retry blind.
- `watchlist_import` no longer claims more than it can deliver. The API appends
  at the end of the list, so import restores membership faithfully but can only
  reproduce *order* when building from empty. It says so now.

### Tests

Mutation testing on the new suite found a test that could not fail for the
reason it claimed. "deleteById throws when the verification read fails" broke
*every* list read, so it threw at the pre-delete presence check and never
reached the post-delete verification — meaning the original 2.2.5 bug could have
been reintroduced in the post-delete path with the whole suite still green. The
mock can now fail from the Nth read onward, and the replacement test was
confirmed to fail against that exact mutation.

Two follow-ups the review asked for on the way to passing:

- **`data_get_study_values` had no behavioural test.** Its fix was verified only
  by a string-grep asserting the function appears in `batch.js`, which proves
  wiring and not behaviour. It matters more than most: `batch_run` stamps
  success on whatever this returns, so a broken read becomes an all-green scan
  that read nothing. Four behavioural cases now cover a broken read, a chart
  with indicators that yield nothing, a genuinely bare chart, and a normal read.
- **The alert resolution check claimed to be a whitelist and was not.** The
  pattern accepts any 1-to-4-digit minute count, deliberately, because
  TradingView supports resolutions this probe did not enumerate and rejecting a
  legitimate one is worse than forwarding it. It fails closed — an unsupported
  value comes back `invalid_request` and `create()` throws — so the comment now
  says it is a shape check rather than the authority on what is accepted.

584 offline tests.

## [2.2.5] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **`chart_get_state` now returns `chart_type` as well as `chartType`.** The same value was called `chartType` here, `chart_type` in `symbol_info`, and taken as `chart_type` by `chart_set_type` — one value, three places, two spellings. An agent that learns the name from `chart_get_state` reads `undefined` everywhere else. That happened twice while sweeping the tool surface, and both times produced a false "this tool is broken" conclusion about a tool that worked perfectly. Both keys are emitted so nothing breaks; snake_case is canonical.

### Notes

- 2.2.4 was tagged but never published to npm. Publish 2.2.5 instead; it contains everything 2.2.4 did.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-08-20

Found by calling all 101 registered tools against a live account and verifying each effect from an independent read, rather than by reading code. Three of them were broken in ways that reported success or returned nothing usable.

### Fixed

- **The watchlist is rebuilt on TradingView's REST API.** Every operation used to be DOM automation — press the add button, or right-click a row and hunt for "Remove" in a context menu. Measured against a live account: `watchlist_remove` reported a click and left the symbol in place; `watchlist_remove_bulk` returned `removed_count: 0`; and `watchlist_get` reported three symbols absent while the account held all of them, because the DOM only contains *rendered* rows. That read is the worst of the three — a membership check that silently under-reports is more dangerous than one that fails, because callers act on it. `get`, `add`, `add_bulk`, `remove` and `remove_bulk` now use `/api/v1/symbols_list/`, and each verifies the result from a second read instead of trusting the mutation's own response. Section headers (`###CORE BASKET`) no longer inflate symbol counts. Price data is still read from the widget when it is open, best-effort.
- **`batch_run` gained `get_study_values`, the action it always documented.** The server's tool guide and the market-open scan skill both instruct callers to run `batch_run({action: "get_study_values"})` to sweep a universe in one call — it is the central step of that workflow. The action existed in neither the schema enum nor the core's allowlist, so every such call died at validation and the documented scan was impossible. Now implemented, and verified returning full indicator values for AAPL and MSFT.
- **`alert_delete_by_id` called an endpoint that does not exist.** `POST /delete_alert` (singular) answers with HTTP 200 and an error *body*, so the old code read the 200, fell through to a DOM path that cannot delete a single alert, and returned failure for something the API does fine. It now posts to `/delete_alerts` with a one-element array — and the id must be numeric, since a string returns a bare `{"s":"error"}`. Verified live: 164 alerts → create → 165 → delete → 164.

### Added

- `tests/watchlist_api.test.js`, `tests/batch_actions.test.js` and `tests/alert_delete_endpoint.test.js`. All are confirmed to fail against the pre-fix source. The batch test asserts that the tool's enum and the core's allowlist agree, because updating one without the other leaves the action dead — which is how the first attempt at that fix failed.

### Notes

- A tool that fails without a readable reason cannot be debugged. Several failures in this sweep surfaced as `undefined: undefined`; where those turned out to be caller error, the tools now say so.
- 54 of 101 tools mutate live state and were exercised with save/verify/restore against a real account. The remainder are documented as deliberately skipped rather than quietly untested.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- The Pine editor is reachable again. `document.querySelector('.monaco-editor.pine-editor-monaco')` returned a collapsed 0x0 node that TradingView keeps in the DOM permanently and that carries no React fiber, so every caller concluded the editor was closed while it was plainly open on screen. The finder now measures each candidate's bounding box and takes the first one with real dimensions.
- Edits reach the chart instead of vanishing. The push path wrote into `getEditors()[0]`, which is detached from any DOM node. Four consecutive rounds of edits compiled clean, reported "Saved", never bumped the script version and never appeared on the chart. The editor is now selected by matching its DOM node against the visible container.
- `pine_save` no longer reports success it did not verify. It returns `saved: true | false | null`, where `null` means unknown. Previously an unverifiable save was indistinguishable from a confirmed one.
- `ui_open_panel('pine-editor', 'open')` works on macOS. It called `bottomWidgetBar.activateScriptEditorTab()` first and clicked `[data-name="pine-dialog-button"]` only as a fallback. On macOS the widget-bar call leaves the editor shut and leaves TradingView believing it is already open, so the click that follows is ignored. The dialog button is now tried first on any build that has it, with the widget bar kept for older builds. Measured against live charts: macOS + Desktop 3.3.0 failed every time before the change and passes 9 of 9 open/close transitions after; Windows + Desktop 3.3.0 and Windows + Chrome passed both before and after, which is why this went unnoticed.
- `ui_open_panel` verifies the panel actually changed state before returning success, and raises a classified `tv_ui_changed` error naming the dialog when it does not. It previously returned success unconditionally, which sent callers hunting for imaginary bugs downstream.
- `npm test` completes. `--test-force-exit` was gated on Node >= 25, but the flag has existed since Node 22.0.0. Without it `tests/state.test.js` passes all 30 of its tests and then holds the event loop open, and because Node's TAP reporter buffers to the end, the hang produced no output at all rather than a visible failure. The gate is now 22. The leaked handle itself is still open and worth finding.
- `js-yaml` bumped to 4.3.1 for CVE-2026-59870. It arrives through `eslint`, a devDependency, so it was never in what customers install; the failing `npm audit` step was blocking CI on every platform.

### Removed

- `skills/market-open-report`. It was built for Wayland Desktop's Smart Trader Assistant and only lived in this repo because that is where the MCP tools it drives were being written. It should never have shipped here. Four of its files are in 2.2.2 and cannot be withdrawn, npm's unpublish window having closed; they are gone from 2.2.3 onward. No strategy research, backtest data or audit was ever in a published package.

### Added

- `tests/pine_editor_finder.test.js` reproduces the exact production DOM — two `.monaco-editor.pine-editor-monaco` nodes with the first collapsed to 0x0, and three editors with index 0 detached — and is confirmed to fail against the pre-fix finder.
- `tests/ui_open_panel_order.test.js` pins the open-path ordering. It exists because the bug is macOS-specific: on Windows the old order looks correct, so nothing on that platform would object to reverting the fix.
- `.githooks/pre-push` refuses to push private research to this public remote. It scans every commit in the range rather than the net diff, because a push uploads all of them and a file added in one commit and deleted in a later one stays browsable on GitHub.

### Note on 2.2.2

2.2.2 was published on 2026-08-05 from a working tree that was never committed. `main` still read 2.2.1, no `v2.2.2` tag was cut, and no changelog entry was written. That is also how four `skills/market-open-report` files reached npm. Releases are cut from `main` from this version onward.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- `tools/list` no longer fails, so MCP clients see the full tool catalog again. In 2.2.0 the request answered `-32603 Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_zod')` and every host — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Wayland — reported zero tools. The cause was a one-argument `z.record()` in `strategy_sweep`: valid under Zod 3, invalid under Zod 4, which requires an explicit key type. The CLI was never affected.
- `zod` is now a declared dependency pinned to `4.3.6`. It was previously imported in 17 source files but resolved transitively through the MCP SDK, so the SDK's own dependency range decided which major version TVControl ran against — which is how a Zod major landed without a TVControl change.

### Added

- `tests/mcp_stdio.test.js` drives `initialize` and `tools/list` against `src/server.js` over real stdio, with an empty environment and a foreign working directory, and checks that every published tool converts to a usable JSON Schema. No previous test spoke MCP: the CLI and core paths never perform schema conversion, so the entire offline suite passed while the MCP server was unusable.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Expanded the MCP catalog from 88 to 102 chart-control and diagnostic tools.
- Added a per-tool capability matrix and runtime gating against live TradingView compatibility checks.
- Added immutable, versioned compatibility snapshots with critical-failure and informational-drift reporting.
- Added privacy-safe compressed support bundles with recursive identifier, secret, path, URL, title, source, and raw-error redaction.
- Added an in-process health watchdog plus bounded transition history.
- Added dry-run-first native watchdog service management for launchd, systemd user services, and Windows Task Scheduler.
- Added bounded chaos scenarios for CDP disconnects, renderer stalls, and tab lifecycle recovery.
- Added health, stream, watchdog, restore, and sweep soak scenarios with abort-safe receipts.
- Added receipt-producing golden workflows for chart, Pine, strategy, watchlist, snapshot, and replay operations.
- Added bulk watchlist add/remove, indicator-dialog search/add, bounded layout pagination, and saved-layout tab creation.
- Added a safe clean-checkout updater that only performs verified fast-forward updates.
- Added cross-process mutation coordination with token-owned, heartbeating filesystem leases.
- Added dedicated pane and indicator-settings regression suites.

### Changed

- Connection handling now uses configurable shared CDP endpoints, bounded HTTP/renderer timeouts, coalesced reconnects, and safer disconnect classification.
- Health checks now report Desktop version, market-data state, reconnect banners, compatibility, and actionable degradation reasons without retaining chart identifiers.
- Native tab management now drives the TradingView Desktop shell tab strip and restores/cleans up tab state more reliably.
- Strategy reads bind to exact entity IDs, unhide the selected strategy when needed, cap returned data, and report incomplete results honestly.
- Quote reads serialize temporary symbol switches and always attempt to restore the starting chart.
- Watchlist, alert, batch, capture, chart-range, stream, Pine, and sweep paths gained stricter validation, bounded waits, and cleanup reporting.
- Windows launch supports Store/MSIX installations and a versioned local fallback when the protected package cannot expose CDP.
- CI now runs lint, offline tests, dependency audit, and package checks on Linux, macOS, and Windows with Node 18 and 22.
- CI uses the Node 24-based official checkout and setup-node action runtimes.
- Offline Pine API checks were separated from live public-service compilation checks so the default suite remains deterministic.
- Dependencies are pinned and package contents are controlled by an explicit npm `files` allowlist.

### Security

- Arbitrary page-context JavaScript remains disabled by default behind `TV_MCP_ADVANCED=1` and is force-logged when used.
- TradingView target matching is hostname-anchored, CDP string interpolation uses JSON encoding, and disk JSON ingestion rejects prototype-pollution keys.
- Export/import and receipt paths are bounded; subprocess execution uses argument arrays rather than shell interpolation.
- Mutation locks prevent concurrent agents from interleaving destructive chart operations.

### Fixed

- Pane focus and symbol operations now reject negative, fractional, non-numeric, and out-of-range indexes with classified `invalid_argument` responses.
- Batch reads now fail safely when chart readiness times out instead of reading stale symbol or timeframe data.
- Indicator search limits now reject fractional and out-of-range values before opening the TradingView dialog.
- Chart readiness and quote switching now preserve exchange-qualified symbol identity, refuse unsafe mutations when starting state is unknown, and verify restoration completion.
- `tab_new` always creates and selects a fresh Desktop tab instead of reusing an existing layout-picker target.
- CLI signal handling no longer suppresses ordinary Ctrl-C termination, and stream reconnect waits are interruptible.
- Reliability receipts and support bundles reject output directories outside `~/.tv-mcp/`.
- Offline receipt and source-scan tests now use platform-native paths on Windows.
- State-changing batch, quote, sweep, and snapshot operations surface restoration and cleanup failures instead of silently leaving chart drift.
