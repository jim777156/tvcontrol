# TVControl

### TradingView MCP System · by [Ferrox Labs](https://github.com/ferroxlabs)

> **Tell your AI what you want from your TradingView chart. Watch it happen on screen.**

TVControl turns your TradingView Desktop into something you can talk to. You type a sentence (*"summarise this chart"*, *"sweep this strategy across SPY, QQQ and IWM on 5m and 15m"*, *"step through last March bar by bar and call out the breakout"*) and the AI reads, clicks, types, compiles and screenshots inside the actual TradingView app on your machine. No copy-paste and no TVControl-operated cloud backend. TradingView Desktop and explicitly selected public-API helpers still communicate with TradingView as documented.

It works because every Chromium app, TradingView Desktop included, ships with a built-in debugging interface (the same one Chrome uses to debug itself). TVControl speaks that interface on your behalf, exposing **113 chart-control and diagnostic tools** to any AI agent that supports the Model Context Protocol (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and others). Pair-program in Pine Script. Optimize parameter grids. Snapshot and restore whole chart setups. Drive 4-pane layouts. Step through replay. Scan a watchlist. All by speech-to-action.

**113 MCP tools · 736 deterministic offline tests · 10 verify scripts · 8 prompt-library workflows · no TVControl cloud backend.** Everything in this repo is real, tested, and used daily.

## What is new in 2.3.0

Version 2.3.0 is about doing a thing once across everything you watch, instead of once per symbol.

- **Set alerts on your whole watchlist in one call.** `alert_create_bulk` takes a list of symbols, or no list at all and uses your active watchlist. Point them all at one `webhook_url` and the notifications go to your app instead of 74 separate emails. Price each one relative to its own last trade with `percent_from_last`, so "5% above here" means something different for every symbol and you never type a number. `dry_run: true` prints the whole batch first. Measured on a 29-symbol watchlist: the dry run takes about half a second, and the chart never moves.
- **Quote a whole list at once.** `quote_batch` returns last, OHLC, change and volume for many symbols in a single server-side call. 29 symbols in 272ms. It names the symbols it could not find rather than quietly returning a shorter list.
- **A destructive Pine bug is fixed.** `pine_new` replaced whatever was in the editor with a template and reported `new_script_created`. It did not create anything, and it is how a real script gets destroyed. It now refuses to overwrite a non-trivial buffer unless you pass `confirm_overwrite: true`, and it fails closed if it cannot read the buffer to check.
- **Silent success is gone from the mutation tools.** A tool that changes something now builds its answer from an independent read, not from the response of the thing it just did. Deleting an alert id that never existed used to return `success: true, verified: true`. Adding a bare ticker to a watchlist used to store the literal string. `draw_clear` used to return a hardcoded `all_shapes_removed` without looking.
- **A broken pane is now detectable and repairable.** A chart pane could get
  stuck in a permanent reconnect loop, and rebuilding the layout by hand looked
  like the only fix. It was a race in TVControl: TradingView returns Promises
  from `createStudy` and friends, and reading the result after a fixed sleep
  instead of awaiting them could leave a study with no server id, which
  destroys that pane's data session on every reconnect from then on. The
  promises are awaited now, an unregistered study is never left behind, and
  `tv_chart_health` and `tv_repair_chart` find and fix a pane that is already
  in that state without touching your layout.
- **The offline suite is actually offline.** It was opening a live CDP connection and calling `removeAllShapes()` against the real chart on every run. It is hermetic now, and a guard makes the next escape a red test rather than a lost drawing.
- **The server no longer misdescribes itself.** Version and tool counts are derived at startup and checked on the wire, after shipping a build that announced itself as 2.2.1 with 102 tools while registering 103.

See the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) and [upgrade guide](./docs/UPGRADING.md).

## What it actually does (with prompts that work)

Paste any of these into Claude Code (or your MCP-compatible agent of choice) once TVControl is wired up.

**Read your chart in one prompt.**
> *Use `chart_vision_read` to summarise my chart: symbol, timeframe, last price, visible indicators with their current values, custom Pine levels and labels, and the last 100-bar move.*

A single tool call returns symbol, timeframe, indicator values, custom Pine drawings, OHLCV summary, and a screenshot. Roughly 5 to 10 KB back instead of ~80 KB across five separate calls.

**Pair-program in Pine Script.**
> *Write me a Pine v6 indicator that plots a 20-period EMA in blue and a 50-period EMA in orange, then compile it on my chart. Fix any errors. Save it as "EMA Cross".*

Inject, server-side compile, read errors, fix, save. The compiler errors come back to the agent directly, so iteration is seconds, not minutes.

**Optimize a parameter grid.**
> *Use `strategy_sweep` to test my current strategy across [`SPY`, `QQQ`, `IWM`] on `5` and `15` with `length` of 10, 14, 20 and `multiplier` of 1.5, 2, 2.5. Rank by net profit.*

Cartesian product, 24h-TTL disk cache (re-runs are near-instant), optional `parallelism: N` worker tabs, resume-from-partial. Caps at 500 combinations.

**Snapshot a setup. Restore it later.**
> *Snapshot my current chart as "morning-prep". Switch to BTCUSDT 4h with VWAP and Bollinger Bands. Done? Restore "morning-prep".*

Captures symbol, timeframe, all studies and their inputs, drawings, and the full `metaInfo` blob for published Pine, even ones that normally won't reload.

**Practice with replay.**
> *Start replay at 2025-03-10 09:30 ET. Step through the open. Call out any breakouts on the 1-min and simulate the entry. Show me the running P&L.*

**Scan a watchlist.**
> *For every symbol in my watchlist, take a 1-day chart screenshot, read the RSI(14), and rank by overbought-to-oversold.*

**Alert on everything you watch, without setting them one at a time.**
> *Set an alert 5% above the last price on every symbol in my watchlist, all pointing at `https://my-app.example/tv-hook`, on bar close, 1h. Show me the dry run first.*

One call. `alert_create_bulk` reads your active watchlist, prices each alert off that symbol's own last trade, and verifies the whole batch with a single read of the alert list afterwards. Everything lands on your webhook, so the filtering, grouping and deduping happen in your code rather than in your inbox.

The full prompt library (every workflow above plus chart analysis, watchlist and alerts, screening, and agent prompting tips) lives in [`examples/prompts/`](./examples/prompts/). Eight files. Copy-pasteable.

## How it stays grounded (the proof)

This isn't a demo. It ships with a test battery.

- **732 offline tests**: Pine analyzer, sanitization, replay, pane and indicator boundaries, watchlist, alerts, state snapshots, sweep planning, vision wrapper, telemetry, capability gating, privacy-safe bundles, chaos cleanup, soak bounds, golden workflows, native watchdog services, update safety, tool registration, and CLI routing. Live Pine-service checks are isolated in `tests/pine_api.test.js`.
- **10 end-to-end verify scripts** under [`examples/verify/`](./examples/verify/) that drive the same MCP tools through the `tv` CLI against a live TradingView. Run `examples/verify/run-all.sh` and it auto-skips when TV isn't up.
- **GitHub Actions CI** runs lint, offline tests, dependency audit, and package checks on Node 18 and 22 across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **CDP smoke** (`scripts/smoke.sh`): live connection sanity check against your local TradingView.

```bash
npm test                                    # offline suite
./examples/verify/00-verify-install.sh      # offline install check
./examples/verify/run-all.sh                # full live battery
```

If your version of TradingView reshapes some internal API, the verify battery is how you'll know within seconds.

## Quick starts

Install the current public release from npm:

```bash
npm install -g @ferroxlabs/tvcontrol
tv --help
```

The package installs both `tv` and `tvcontrol`. For MCP-server configuration, use the installed `src/server.js` or one of the repository paths below.

### Path A. Claude Code, one prompt to install

Paste this into Claude Code once and let it do the rest.

> Install the TVControl MCP server. Clone https://github.com/ferroxlabs/tvcontrol.git into ~/tvcontrol, run `npm install`, add it to my Claude Code MCP config at `~/.claude/.mcp.json` as a server named `tvcontrol` pointing at `~/tvcontrol/src/server.js`, then run `tv_launch` to start TradingView in debug mode and `tv_health_check` to confirm the connection.

Claude Code will clone, install, register the server, and verify. Restart Claude Code when it finishes so the new MCP server loads.

### Path B. Manual, any MCP client

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/ferroxlabs/tvcontrol.git
cd tvcontrol
npm install

# 2. Launch TradingView with the debug port enabled (one-time, per platform)
./scripts/launch_tv_debug_mac.sh        # macOS
./scripts/launch_tv_debug_linux.sh      # Linux
scripts\launch_tv_debug.bat             # Windows

# Or by hand on any platform:
/path/to/TradingView --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

On Windows Store/MSIX installations, `tv_launch` also detects the package with `Get-AppxPackage`. If Windows blocks CDP from the protected `WindowsApps` directory, it launches a versioned local copy under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tvcontrol\desktop-cache` and reports `msix_local_copy: true`.

Then add this to your MCP client config (`~/.claude/.mcp.json` for Claude Code, equivalent location for Codex / Gemini CLI / Cursor), replacing the path with your absolute path.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tvcontrol": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/tvcontrol/src/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your client. A copy-pasteable example config lives at [`examples/mcp-config.example.json`](./examples/mcp-config.example.json).

Verify with:
> *Use `tv_health_check`, then `chart_vision_read` to summarise my chart.*

If you get back a paragraph describing your actual chart, you're up.

### Path C. CLI only (no agent required)

Every MCP tool is also a `tv` command, JSON-out, jq-friendly. Skip the AI client entirely if you just want a programmable handle on your TradingView.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ferroxlabs/tvcontrol.git
cd tvcontrol
npm install
npm link                          # optional: puts `tv` on your PATH

# launch TV with debug port (see Path B), then:
tv status                         # connection check
tv quote                          # latest price
tv ohlcv --summary                # compact stats
tv pine compile                   # compile current Pine on chart
tv stream quote | jq '.close'     # tick-by-tick price stream
```

## CLI surface

```
tv status / launch / state / symbol / timeframe / type / info / search
tv quote / ohlcv / values
tv data lines / labels / tables / boxes / strategy / trades / equity / depth / indicator
tv pine get / set / compile / analyze / check / save / new / open / list / errors / console
tv draw shape / list / get / remove / clear
tv alert list / create / delete
tv watchlist get / add / remove / export / import
tv indicator add / remove / toggle / set / get
tv layout list / switch
tv pane list / layout / focus / symbol
tv tab list / new / close / switch
tv replay start / step / stop / status / autoplay / trade
tv stream quote / bars / values / lines / labels / tables / all
tv ui click / keyboard / hover / scroll / find / eval / type / panel / fullscreen / mouse
tv screenshot / discover / ui-state / range / scroll
tv capabilities / support
tv chaos / soak / golden
tv compatibility / watchdog sample / watchdog history / watchdog service-plan
```

All commands return JSON. Core chart-control tools have CLI counterparts; long-running or disruptive reliability runners are deliberately CLI-first.

## Reliability toolkit

The compatibility layer checks the TradingView APIs required by each tool before execution. A tool is blocked only when the live canary explicitly confirms a required API is absent; if the canary itself is unavailable, recovery tools are still allowed to run.

```bash
tv capabilities                       # per-tool live capability matrix
tv support                            # redacted .json.gz support bundle
tv chaos                              # dry-run fault plan
tv chaos --allow-live-faults          # bounded disconnect/stall/tab recovery checks
tv soak --duration-ms 3600000         # health + stream + watchdog soak
tv golden                             # six receipt-producing live workflows
tv watchdog service-plan              # native service definition, no changes
tv watchdog install --apply           # launchd/systemd-user/Task Scheduler
```

Chaos is dry-run unless `--allow-live-faults` is present. Restore/sweep soak scenarios and snapshot/replay golden checks require `--allow-mutations`. Watchdog install and uninstall are dry-run unless `--apply` is present. Receipts are bounded and omit symbols, URLs, account-linked identifiers, source code, and raw error messages.

---

## Streaming

`tv stream` polls your local TradingView Desktop over CDP and emits JSONL. TVControl has no streaming cloud backend; TradingView Desktop continues to communicate with TradingView normally.

```bash
tv stream quote                          # tick-by-tick price
tv stream bars                           # bar-by-bar updates
tv stream values                         # indicator values
tv stream lines --filter "NY Levels"     # custom Pine levels
tv stream tables --filter Profiler       # Pine table rows
tv stream all                            # all panes at once
```

## Architecture

```
AI Agent  <->  MCP Server (stdio)  <->  CDP (localhost:9222)  <->  TradingView Desktop (Electron)
```

- **Transport:** MCP over stdio plus a `tv` CLI exposing the same surface.
- **Connection:** Chrome DevTools Protocol on `localhost:9222`.
- **Streaming:** poll-and-diff loop with deduplication, JSONL on stdout.
- **Runtime deps:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `chrome-remote-interface`. That's it.

The full per-tool decision tree (*which tool to call for which question*) lives in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md). Read that once if you want to understand how the agent picks tools.

---

## How this stays safe to run

- The debug port is off in TradingView until *you* enable it via the standard `--remote-debugging-port=9222` flag.
- TVControl's chart-control path speaks CDP to the Electron app already running on your machine. TradingView Desktop and explicitly documented public helpers still communicate with TradingView.
- TVControl does not operate a cloud backend. Local snapshots, telemetry, reliability receipts, and support bundles are written only when their corresponding features are used.
- No real trades are executed. Chart, drawings, indicators, and Pine code only.
- **`TV_MCP_READONLY=1` registers only the tools that cannot change your TradingView state.** For unattended use — a scheduled morning brief, a cron job, a CI agent — where nobody is there to approve a call. An MCP grant is server-level, so a host that can reach TVControl can reach every tool it registers; under this flag the mutating ones are never registered, so calling one is an unknown-tool error rather than a promise the model is asked to keep. Reads, diagnostics, screenshots and chart navigation (symbol, timeframe, range, pane/tab/layout switching) stay available; watchlist edits, alert create/delete, drawing writes, indicator changes, Pine saves, replay, `state_restore` and `tv_launch` do not. `ui_evaluate` stays off even if `TV_MCP_ADVANCED=1` is also set.

The same CDP interface is built into every Chromium app: VS Code, Slack, Discord, Chrome itself. It's not a side door; it's the standard debugging interface Google ships with the runtime.

---

## Compatibility

- TVControl talks to undocumented internal TradingView APIs through the Electron debug interface. Those can change in any TradingView update without notice. Pin your TradingView Desktop version if stability matters to you.
- Tested on macOS, Windows, and Linux at release time.
- Requires Node.js 18+.

## Acknowledgements

TVControl began as a fork of [`tradingview-mcp`](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp) by **tradesdontlie**. That project established the core CDP-bridge approach and the original tool surface, and proved the whole "drive TradingView Desktop from an MCP agent" pattern was viable.

TVControl builds on that foundation with full state snapshot and restore (including the `metaInfo` blob for published Pine), Cartesian strategy sweeps with disk memoization and parallel worker tabs, the combined `chart_vision_read` one-shot, classified-error handling with remediation hints, opt-in JSONL telemetry, capability-aware runtime gates, privacy-safe diagnostics, watchdog services, chaos/soak/golden verification, an expanded offline test battery, end-to-end verify scripts, cross-platform GitHub Actions CI, and a curated prompt library.
