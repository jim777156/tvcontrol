// without passing _deps, so the "unit" test ran removeAllShapes() against the
// operator's real chart. Both now thread _deps, and TV_MCP_NO_CDP below makes
// any future escape throw instead of connecting.
//
// Force-exit was not just papering over that — it was CAUSING the count wobble

// comment documents, and when it wins the run ends early — with a smaller
// passing suite and a zero exit code.
