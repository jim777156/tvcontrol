/**
 * AWAIT THE PROMISE. THIS IS THE BUG BEHIND THE BROKEN-PANE REPORTS.
 *
 * TradingView changed these to return Promises (createStudy returns
 * Promise<EntityId> as of charting library 1.15; the callback argument was
 * removed). Confirmed in the live Desktop build on 2026-08-21:
 *
 *     createStudy            async: true
 *     createMultipointShape  async: true
 *     setSymbol              async: true
 *     setResolution          async: true
 *
 * Calling them fire-and-forget and then sleeping a fixed interval before
 * reading the result is a race. Win it and everything looks fine. Lose it and
 * the study exists on the chart with NO server id, its id reads as [], and on
 * the pane's next reconnect create_study is sent with that [] and the server
 * answers "Invalid parameters" as a CRITICAL error, which destroys the chart
 * session. The pane then loops on reconnect forever and cannot recover: while
 * it is in that state symbolSameAsResolved() returns true, so re-setting the
 * same symbol is a silent no-op.
 *
 * That is why it struck at random and why the only apparent cure was rebuilding
 * the layout. See core/session_health.js for detection and repair.
 *
 * Builds an expression that resolves only when the call really finished.
 * `timeoutMs` bounds it so a hung call reports rather than hanging the tool.
 */
/**
 * In-page JS counting studies with this description that have NO usable id.

/**
 * A STUDY WITH NO id IS DAMAGED, AND IT USED TO BE REPORTED AS THOUGH IT WERE
 * NORMAL.
 *
 * CORRECTION: an earlier version of this note claimed TradingView gives every
 * Pine study an empty Array as its id. It does not. Measured on two panes of
 * one layout: the healthy pane's Pine studies had ids "Uqd28X" and "rExi1w",
 * the broken pane's had []. The empty Array means the study never registered
 * with the server, and such a study destroys its pane's chart session on the
 * next reconnect. It is reported here so the caller is warned, not so it can be
 * worked around. See core/session_health.js.
 *
 * The original note, still true, follows.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-21 against TradingView Desktop: getAllStudies() gives
 * built-ins a string id ("T4x6LH") and gives every Pine study its own distinct
 * empty Array. getStudyById resolves that by reference identity, so a fresh []
 * throws "There is no such study". Serializing it over CDP is the same as
 * throwing it away. Four tools take an entity_id string, so every one of them
 * was unreachable for a Pine study, and the caller was told the id was []
 * rather than told why.
 *
 * getState now reports null for those, says the study is addressable by name,
 * and returns the script id from metaInfo so it is at least identifiable.
 * See _study_ref.js for the resolver the write paths use.
 *
 * The explanation lives out here rather than inside the template literal below:
 * everything in that literal is shipped to the browser on every single call,
 * and this comment alone was 700 bytes of prose per evaluate.
