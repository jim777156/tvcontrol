/**
 * TV_MCP_READONLY=1 — register ONLY the tools that cannot mutate the user's TradingView state.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * An MCP grant is server-level, not per-tool. A host that is allowed to talk to tvcontrol at
 * all is allowed to call every tool tvcontrol registers. That is fine when a human approves
 * each call. It is not fine for an UNATTENDED run — a scheduled 07:00 briefing, a cron job, a
 * CI agent — where nobody approves anything and the account on the other end is a real trading
 * account. In that context the same grant that lets an agent read a Pine table also lets it
 * call watchlist_remove_bulk, alert_delete, draw_clear, pine_save or tv_launch.
 *
 * With TV_MCP_READONLY=1 the mutating tools are NOT REGISTERED. They are absent from
 * tools/list and a call to one is rejected by the MCP layer as an unknown tool. The safety
 * property is structural, not a promise the model is asked to keep.
 *
 * THE LINE THIS ALLOWLIST DRAWS
 *
 * Read-only here means "cannot change anything the user owns", not "does not touch the app":
 *
 *   ALLOWED — pure reads; reads that open and close a panel to get their answer; reads that
 *   write a NEW local artifact (a screenshot, a state snapshot file); and chart NAVIGATION —
 *   symbol, timeframe, visible range, pane focus, tab and layout switching. Navigation moves
 *   the view of a human who may be watching, which is why it is called out rather than waved
 *   through, but it destroys nothing and is undone by navigating back. A universe scan cannot
 *   work without it: reading a Pine table for 74 symbols means setting the symbol 74 times.
 *
 *   DENIED — anything that PERSISTS or DESTROYS: watchlist edits, alert create/delete,
 *   drawing writes, indicator add/remove/retune, Pine buffer writes and saves, replay (which
 *   takes the chart out of realtime and can place simulated trades), state_restore (documented
 *   destructive — it makes the chart MATCH the snapshot, dropping studies and drawings),
 *   state_delete, layout structure changes, tab create/close, strategy_sweep (it rewrites
 *   indicator inputs), and every process-level action: tv_launch, tv_update, tv_repair_chart,
 *   watchdog start/stop. Raw UI actuation (ui_click, ui_keyboard, ui_type_text, ui_mouse_click,
 *   ui_scroll, ui_hover, ui_fullscreen, ui_open_panel) is denied because it is a general-purpose
 *   mutation primitive: anything the mouse can do to the account, it can do.
 *
 * THREE CALLS WORTH ARGUING WITH — deliberate, and cheap to reverse if you disagree:
 *
 *   watchlist_export — non-mutating for TradingView, but it takes a caller-supplied
 *   destination path and overwrites it. The path allowlist keeps that inside $HOME or /tmp,
 *   which still covers plenty of files somebody cares about. A read tool that can clobber a
 *   file is not a read tool in an unattended run.
 *
 *   tv_support_bundle / tv_compatibility_snapshot — non-mutating for TradingView, but one
 *   packages identifiers, URLs and source into a durable artifact and the other records a
 *   compatibility BASELINE that later runs compare themselves against. Neither has any read
 *   value for an unattended brief, and both leave something behind that nobody reviewed.
 *
 *   pine_check — posts caller-supplied Pine source to a third-party compile endpoint. It
 *   changes nothing, but paired with pine_get_source it is an egress path for a private
 *   strategy. Breaking one half of that pair costs an unattended run nothing.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED. The allowlist is an ENUMERATION, so a tool added tomorrow is denied under
 * readonly until somebody puts it in this list on purpose. tests/readonly.test.js asserts
 * every name here exists in the live catalog, so the list cannot rot into fiction either.
